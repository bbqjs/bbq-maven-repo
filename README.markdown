BBQjs Maven repository.  To use add the following to your Pom:

	<distributionManagement>
		<repository>
			<id>repo</id>
			<url>https://github.com/bbqjs/bbq-maven-repo/raw/master/releases</url>
		</repository>
		<snapshotRepository>
			<id>snapshot-repo</id>
			<url>https://github.com/bbqjs/bbq-maven-repo/raw/master/snapshots</url>
		</snapshotRepository>
	</distributionManagement>

Hopefully at some point we'll make it into Maven Central and this won't be necessary.
